  no-nonsense insights for product builders, developers, and innovators who
  value substance over hype.</p>

  <p>We started TinkByte because the tech space is full of noise. Every day
  brings new revolutionary tools, groundbreaking frameworks, and
  industry-changing announcements. But here is the thing - most of it does not
  matter for actual builders.</p>
