## The Problem with Modern Product Development

Most products today are built backwards. Teams start with features, add complexity, then wonder why users don't engage.

Here's what actually works...

### 1. Start with Real Problems

Before writing a single line of code, spend time understanding the actual problem you're solving.

### 2. Build for Humans, Not Metrics

Metrics matter, but they shouldn't drive every decision. Focus on creating genuine value.

## Key Takeaways

- **Problem-first approach**: Always start with the user's real pain point
- **Iterative validation**: Test assumptions early and often
- **Meaningful metrics**: Track what matters for long-term success

Remember: Great products solve real problems elegantly.
