## **A**

### **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**
**Definition:** AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capability.

**Example:** A hypothetical AI system that can write code, compose music, solve mathematical proofs, and engage in philosophical discussions with equal proficiency.

**Use Case:** Currently theoretical, but would revolutionize every industry by providing human-level reasoning for any task.

**Status in 2025:** Still in research phase, with significant debate about timeline and feasibility.

### **AI Agent**
**Definition:** An autonomous AI system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

**Example:** A customer service agent that can access multiple systems, understand customer issues, and resolve problems without human intervention.

**Use Case:** Automating complex workflows like lead qualification, customer onboarding, or technical support.

**Real Implementation:**
```javascript
class CustomerServiceAgent {
  async handleCustomerIssue(issue) {
    const analysis = await this.analyzeIssue(issue);
    const solution = await this.findSolution(analysis);
    const response = await this.generateResponse(solution);
    return await this.executeAction(response);
  }
}
